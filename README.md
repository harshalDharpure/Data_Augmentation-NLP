# Data_Augmentation-NLP
Data Augmentation using Natural Language Procesing.


we might have optimal machine learning algorithm to solve our problem. But once we apply it in real world soon we will realize that you need to train it on more data. Due to lack of large dataset you will try to further optimize the algorithm, tune hyper-parameters or look for some low tech approach. Most state of the art machine learning models are trained on large datasets. Real world performance of machine learning solutions drastically improves with more data.

# Here we are dealing with various NLP Data Augmentation technique :-

Data Augmentation using Word Embeddings

Data Augmentation using BERT

Data Augmentation using Back Translation

Data Augmentation using T5
